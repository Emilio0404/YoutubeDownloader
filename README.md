# YoutubeDownloader

This is a personal project I created to help my family download YouTube videos for personal use. 
It works using PyTube and Tkinter. 

I used this project to learn about creating GUIs, reading documentation, and using APIs.

## How to use:

This app only requires Python and the Pytube library. You can install it using:

```
$ pip install pytube
```

Check out the [pytube documentation](https://pytube.io/en/latest/)


**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Playlists have to be public to be downloaded, the PyTube doesn't handle private playlists.
